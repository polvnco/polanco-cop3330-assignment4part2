# The Help
## _Our Dedication to Ray and some deets about this app_

Here after these lines, I will describe what has been implemented and working on this app. Please have mercy on me...

- List with the capacity to store 100 unique items
- Items with a due date
  -- Also displayed in YYYY-MM-DD format
  -- Within Gregorian Calendar
- Add Item
- A help screen

## What It Does

There has been quite a bit of struggles when attempting to finish this app, hence it's incompleteness, but it does somehow function.

##### Add Item

>
> To add an item, fill in a string in the fields "Task"
> and "Task Description" choose a date with the Date
> Picker and select whether if the task was "complete" or
> "not complete" in the Choice Box. Once the button "Add
> to List" is clicked on, it will be added to the list.
